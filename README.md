# superSFS
This is a tool for speculation of ancestral allel, calculation of sfs and drawing its bar plot. It is easy-to-use and runing fast. What you should prepare is the phased vcf file containg the data of populations you interested and the outgroup, the outgroup name file, and the annotation file. Enjoy it!!!
